Proposal: How did opening up marijuana dispensaries impact neighborhoods in the state of Colorado?
           Where are they located?
           Home prices (Zillow)
           Employment rates (??)
           Income (??)
           
1. First find a list of dispenaries in COL by zip code.
2. Use zip code as reference for finding home prices, employment rates, and income.
           *variables may change. Dependent on what data we are able / not able to find.
3. Follow up with where we should open a dispensary?
           Would require other analysis such as:
                      Dispensary sales
                      Customers
                      etc.
